Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Round-Robin.


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 958.5ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 800ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1.5ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 480ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A or Exercise 4B?
4A

Exercise 5:

Process 4 was interrupted before it could copy `4' to `cursorpos'.
(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)


Anything else you'd like us to know:
Exercise 2:

Add `int p_priority' to the process descriptor.
During initialization, assign priorities accordingly.
Schedule according to `p_priority'.
