Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Round-Robin.


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 958.5ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 800ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1.5ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 480ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A or Exercise 4B?
4A & 4B

Exercise 5:

Process 4 was interrupted before it could copy `4' to `cursorpos'.

(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)


Anything else you'd like us to know:
Exercise 2:

Add `int p_priority' to the process descriptor.
During initialization, assign priorities accordingly.
Schedule according to `p_priority'.

Exercise 4A:

Like exercise 2, `p_priority' plays an important role here.
Introduce a pointer to record last executed pid (a clock algorithm).
During every loop, traverse the process array for the highest priority.
Next, traverse the process array again, find the first process with the highest
priority and behind the last executed process.
If we cannot find a qualified process, reset last executed pid to 0.

Exercise 4B:

Introduce a new array for candidates.
A process is qualified for being a candidate if it has a nonzero share.
During every loop, first check for all qualified processes.
If there is no qualified process, reset the share of everyone to its maximum and
continue.
Else, randomly pick a candidate, decrement its share and run it.
